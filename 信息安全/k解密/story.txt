One day, in the forest, the hare and the tortoise competed for running. The Hare laughed at the tortoise's slow climb. The tortoise said, "one day I will win." the hare said contemptuously, "let's start the race now!" the tortoise agreed, and the hare shouted, "the race begins!"
The rabbit ran fast and the tortoise climbed desperately. After a while, the rabbit and the tortoise were far away. The rabbit thought the race was too easy. He had to sleep for a while first, and said that even if he woke up, the tortoise might not be able to catch up with him. The tortoise kept crawling, crawling and crawling. When he got to the rabbit, he was very tired, but the tortoise thought that if he went to rest like the rabbit at this time, he would not win the game, so the tortoise continued to climb and climb. When the rabbit woke up, the tortoise had reached the end. This story tells you: don't underestimate others easily. Modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people lag behind. We should do things in a down-to-earth manner, not give up halfway, in order to achieve success.
